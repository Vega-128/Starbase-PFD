# Starbase-PFD

This is a primary flight display built in starbase.

in order for this module to work you will need:
* it the "gyro LEQ" module from the nav suite
* an advanced display to render the PFD onto.
* a button named "RSTADI" to reset the initializer chip in case pixels get stuck

these things are included in the .fbe file.

# Considerations when installing the module

the groups in the rack need to stay together in order to have propper network isolation.
