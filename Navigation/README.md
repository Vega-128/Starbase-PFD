# Navigation
the navigation section is dedicated to subsystems with the purpose of having the ship know where it is and where it's going

the primary purpose for systems in this section is to provides sources for:
- absolute position
- absolute rotation

furthermore the systems providing the intermediary data to calculate these are also found here:
- 3 axis speedometer
- accurate clock
- relative position
- relative rotation

depending on implementaion not all the intermediary data is required.
